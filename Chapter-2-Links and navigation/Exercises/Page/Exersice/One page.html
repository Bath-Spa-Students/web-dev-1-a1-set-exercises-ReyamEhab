    <h2> ☘ Storyline </h2>
    <p>
          It is Christmas time and the McCallister family is preparing for a vacation in <b>Paris, France</b>. But the youngest<br>
        in the family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was<br>
        sent to his room, which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the<br>
         family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the<br>
          house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for <b>Kevin</b>, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his<br>
          parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, <b>Kevin discovers about two burglars</b>, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv<br>
         (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with<br>
        makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.—John Wiggins<br>

<p>
  Joe Pesci deliberately avoided Macaulay Culkin on-set because he wanted Culkin to think he was mean.</p>

<p>
    The night <b> Harry</b> and <b>Marv</b> break in to the house, Kevin sits down and blesses his macaroni and<br>

<p>
    In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite<br>
      rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In<br>
     one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox<br>
    to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have<br>
     known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes<br>
     and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes,<br>
     Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment,<br>
     or sickening amounts of gooey love.

    <h2>☘ FAQ </h2><hr>
    <details>
         <summary>In the beginning of the movie, where was Marv at when <b>Harry</b> showed up at the McCallisters' house as a police officer?</summary>
         <p><b>Marv</b> was probably either waiting for Harry outside the van or was possibly looking at other potential houses to rob.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
         <summary>Did anybody discover that Harry Lyme was disguised as a Police officer?</summary>
            <p>No, and the film never reveals any person discovering that Harry was a disguised policeman.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
         <summary>Behind Kevin's mom in the Airport, is that Elvis Presley as an extra?</summary>
       <p>No it was debunked. The Extra who looks a lot like Elvis was in fact a friend of the Director. Plus, seeing<br>
            as how Elvis Presley died in 1977, it's highly unlikely he would randomly show up as a background<br>
             player in a movie made 13 years later</p>
