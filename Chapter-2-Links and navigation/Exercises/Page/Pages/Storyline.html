   <h2> ☘ Storyline </h2>
   <p>
         It is Christmas time and the McCallister family is preparing for a vacation in <b>Paris, France</b>. But the youngest<br>
       in the family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was<br>
       sent to his room, which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the<br>
        family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the<br>
         house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for <b>Kevin</b>, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his<br>
         parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, <b>Kevin discovers about two burglars</b>, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv<br>
        (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with<br>
       makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.—John Wiggins<br>
