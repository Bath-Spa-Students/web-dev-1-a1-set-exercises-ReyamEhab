            In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite<br>
              rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In<br>
             one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox<br>
            to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have<br>
             known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes<br>
             and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes,<br>
             Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment,<br>
             or sickening amounts of gooey love.
